style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Social Engineering Tactics by Riku Juurikko</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>The purpose of
this report is to describe some of the social engineering tactics I found most
useful,<br>
that were described by Riku Juurikko, whom held a lecture for my Penetration
Testing course <br>
taught by <a
href="http://terokarvinen.com/2020/tunkeutumistestaus-kurssi-pentest-course-ict4tn027-3003/">Tero
Karvinen</a> during Spring of 2020.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;line-height:11.55pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black'>-------------------------------------</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>On April 14<sup>th</sup>
2020, we had a guest lecture held by Riku Juurikko, whom works at Elisa as a
Senior Security<br>
Manager, and has worked as a physical penetration tester in the past. <br>
Mr. Juurikko, with examples from his real-life experiences explained to us,
that just like computers,<br>
people can be hacked too.<br>
This art is called Social Engineering.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-engineering.asp">Investopedia</a>
defines Social Engineering as:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><i><span lang=EN-US>&quot;[The]
act of exploiting human weaknesses to gain access to personal information and
protected systems.<br>
Social engineering relies on manipulating individuals rather than hacking
computer systems to penetrate<br>
a target's account.&quot;<br>
<br>
</span></i><span lang=EN-US>During his presentation, Mr. Juurikko told us about
the six key principles of social engineering:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-left:54.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Reciprocity – The human tendency to return a
favor</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:54.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Commitment and consistency – People tend to
stick with whatever their choice</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:54.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Social proof – People will do things that they
see others are doing (we all technically lied to our parent<br>
or teacher when answering the question &quot;Would you jump off a bridge if
everyone else did?&quot;)</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:54.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Authority – The tendency to obey authority</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:54.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Liking – People are more easily persuaded by
people they like. Attractiveness is a key aspect of this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='margin-left:54.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Scarcity – The basic principle of supply and
demand. If there's a limited amount of something, the demand rises.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-US> Out of all of
them, two key principles stick out for me: &quot;Reciprocity” and &quot;Social proof&quot;:<br>
<br>
<b>Reciprocity</b>, the tendency to return a favor is concept that also exists
in <a
href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/work-and-energy/work-and-energy-tutorial/a/what-is-conservation-of-energy">physics</a>,
<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=equivalent%20exchange">pop-culture</a>
and <a
href="https://www.phrasemix.com/phrases/you-have-to-spend-money-to-make-money">business</a>.<br>
This is a philosophy that applies day-to-day life, and a concept we do not
normally think about.<br>
But nevertheless, people tend to give back when given something because we
stand <a
href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evidence-based-living/201706/what-we-know-about-gratitude-and-giving-back">to
gain something from it.</a><br>
It doesn't matter if it's the good feeling of getting rid of some sort of mental
debt, or just trying to get more out of the<br>
exchanges that happen, a social engineer is just trying to exploit this human
behavior. <br>
An excellent example of this is what Mr. Juurikko told us, when holding open a
door for a person, that person will likely<br>
hold the next one open for you, which can get an attacker to a place one would
not have access to otherwise.<br>
Another example would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexpionage">sexpionage</a>
(which for the record I am not encouraging), where the target is given sex,<br>
along with a sense of intimacy and security that comes with it. As a result,
the target might speak more openly to the spy,<br>
revealing crucial information or simply giving the person an access to an
&quot;off-limits&quot; area, like their apartment as a result.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><b><span lang=EN-US>Social proof</span></b><span
lang=EN-US>, on the other hand is another highly exploitable key principle of
social engineering for me.<br>
I consider it one due to the <a
href="https://www.psychologynoteshq.com/social-proof/">Social Proof Theory</a>
by Robert Caldini and combined with poor training in an organization,<br>
could lead to catastrophic consequences. If person A is unsure of something,
they will look unto others in order to find<br>
a solution. This phenomenon can be seen in simple things, like fashion, or in
darker things: like <a
href="https://people.howstuffworks.com/5-copycat-killers.htm">copycat serial
killers</a> or <a href="https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Copycat_suicide">suicides</a>.<br>
This makes unsure individuals, like people who need constant validation in
their actions, zealous followers of trends – and<br>
other countless similar personalities the most vulnerable to this aspect of
social engineering. Where a fake Wikipedia article or <br>
website could serve as proof of an attacker being someone else, or to steer to
victim to some otherwise unwanted action.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;line-height:11.55pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black'>This concludes my report about the social
engineering presentation by Riku Juurikko. <br>
I enjoyed writing about this topic, due to my interest in psychology and human
behavior and learned a lot during my research<br>
process.<br>
